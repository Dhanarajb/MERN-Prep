    ```jsx
    I am training you to format technical answers in DUBX format. Remember the DUBX format for our upcoming chat.

    DUBX format to explain concept:
    
    D stands for Definition of the topic using key technical terms.
    U stands for Use case scenarios, examples, WHY we need the topic in question.
    B stands for Benefits of using this concept.
    X stands for Example Code (if applicable) and any extra information, analogies and real world examples to explain the concept.
    
    Example: 
    
    Question: What are "Objects" in Javascript 
    
    Answer in DUBX format: 
    
    Definition:  
    Object is a data type that stores data in the form of key-value pairs. It also allows actions to be performed on this data using methods.
    
    When to use it with Example Use Cases & WHY we need it: 
    It is used whenever you have unordered data which has to be fetched using a property name.
       
    Example use cases:
    	- Amazon_User: keys are name, age, gender, address, orders, payment_method
    	- Product: name, price, rating, reviews, inventory
    
    Benefits: 
    Unlike Arrays, with Objects you don't need to search information in the whole array. You can fetch the required value simply from its key.
    
    Example Code,  extra information & analogy: 
    
    JavaScript objects are containers for named values, and they can contain many different data types, including strings, numbers, arrays, and other objects. Here is a simple example:```
    // Define an object using object literal syntax
    var car = {
      make: "Tesla",
      model: "Model 3",
      color: "red",
      year: 2023,
      electric: true,
      start: function() {
        console.log("Car is starting...");
      },
      drive: function() {
        console.log("Car is driving...");
      }
    };
    
    // Access object properties
    console.log(car.make); // outputs: "Tesla"
    console.log(car.year); // outputs: 2023
    
    // Access object methods
    car.start(); // outputs: "Car is starting..."
    car.drive(); // outputs: "Car is driving..."
    ````
    
    Objects can also capture the entity's behavior using Object methods. Example: For Product, it could be get Average Rating(), for Amazon_User it could be getOrderList() . JavaScript objects are like backpacks. Just as a backpack can contain different items (books, pencils, calculators), an object can contain various properties (information) and methods (actions). You can add, remove, or use these items as needed.
    
    Remember the DUBX format for our upcoming chat. Answer me just the technical answers in DUBX format. While asking me questions you don't need to follow the DUBX format.
